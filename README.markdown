`fd.js` is a Javascript finite domain constraint programming (CP) library with
a design based on the CP features of [Mozart/Oz]. In particular, `fd.js` aims to
separate the concerns of constraint problem specification, branching strategy
and search strategy through the use of "computation spaces".

## Status

Work has just about begun, but the code is already useful enough to solve
simple puzzles like sudoku.
